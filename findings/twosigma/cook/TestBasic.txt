Programming Language - Python
Number of Tests - 1

Cause (RQ1) - Collections
Fix (RQ2) - The test relies on the the collection containing specific instances, which flakily fail. Developers fixed this error by making the collection only contain the instances (failing in this case) that the test cares about.
