Programming Language - Java
Number of Tests - 9

Cause (RQ1) - Async Wait
Fix (RQ2) - Developers added a shutdown() function that ensures that client and server instances properly shutdown after usage and make sure that no other events are possible after shutdown. Before, there was flakiness as some client / server instances continued to function and perform events even after termination.
