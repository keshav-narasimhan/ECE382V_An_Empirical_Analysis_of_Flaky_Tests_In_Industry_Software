Programming Language - Swift
Number of Tests - 1

Cause (RQ1) - Incorrect Program Logic
Fix (RQ2) - Developers added a tolerance to allow some wiggle room for the variable to change its value from a method execution, instead of immediately checking to see if the variable's value had changed in the test code.
