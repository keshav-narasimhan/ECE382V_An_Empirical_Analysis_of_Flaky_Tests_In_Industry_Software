Programming Language - Swift
Number of Tests - 1

Cause (RQ1) - Platform / Environment Issues
Fix (RQ2) - The flakiness in this test arose from the fact that a certain UI element was buggy on certain versions of XCode due to invalid bitcodes. Developers fixed this issue by making the element backwards-compatible with older versions of XCode.
