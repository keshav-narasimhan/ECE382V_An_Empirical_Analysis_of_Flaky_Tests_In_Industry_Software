Programming Language - Kotlin
Number of Tests - 1

Cause (RQ1) - Delay / Wait
Fix (RQ2) - This test tests the functionality of the payment sheet on an Android app. Flakiness arises in this test when there is not enough time for the sheet to animate onto the screen. To fix the flakiness, developers added a custom delay in order to set aside time for the animations to take place.
