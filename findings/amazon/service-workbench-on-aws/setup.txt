Programming Language - JavaScript
Number of Tests - 1

Cause (RQ1) - Incorrect Program Logic
Fix (RQ2) - The test was flaky because some test executions wouldn't setup the state for the test correctly. Developers fixed this issue by explicitely setting up the instance in the event that the execution hadn't already.
